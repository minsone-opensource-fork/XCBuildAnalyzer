# ![icon](docs/img/icon.png) XCBuildAnalyzer

macOS app to inspect Xcode's build system graph

## Description


## Getting Started

To analyze your most recent build system graph, drag&drop a project file to the application area. Depending on a size of a project and nodes in a graph, it may take some time but usually should finish within couple of seconds.

On a left pane you will see graph nodes aggregated by target names (if applicable). The build graph is very often massive so to improve the reliability and performance, analyzing a subgraph is recommended.

Selecting a node will render a view with all input and output nodes in the center view.

If a node has some hidden input or outputs that were skipped for brevity, the node's icon â¤¡ or â¤¢ allow expanding them.

Selecting multiple nodes (using âŒ˜ or â‡§) in a left view draws the possible subgraph that includes all nodes.

On a right pane, you can inspect step details including input/output nodes, step tool, ENV variables etc.

If a build timing data was found along the build manifest, steps that were triggered in the most recent build have timing data. Look for ðŸ”¨ icons to found nodes that were recently executed.

#### Cycles

If a cycle has been found in the graph, affected nodes have a warning sign. Selecting them draws the full cycle (with some few side nodes):
